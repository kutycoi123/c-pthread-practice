Pointers in C
-------------

1) Consider the following C program.
#include <string.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char *temp;
  strcpy(temp, argv[0]);
  return 0;
}

Why is the above code incorrect (i.e., likely to crash)?
The pointer temp is not allocated with any memory space yet. It's just a pointer variable pointing to nowhere. 

2) Consider the following C program.
#include <string.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char temp[9];
  strcpy(temp, argv[0]);
  return 0;
}

A buffer overflow occurs when the program name is 9 characters long
(e.g., "12345.exe"). Why?
Since c string always contain terminating null character '\0' so the name turns out to have 10 characters long
However, temp can only have 9 characters (including null character) so it causes overflow.

3) Consider the following C program.
#include <string.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char *buffer = "Hello";
  strcpy(buffer, "World");
  return 0;
}

Why does this program crash?
Because buffer pointer is poiting to a string literal which behaves like a static memory space so 
any attempt to change values in these static memory space will cause program crash

4) Consider the following C snippet.
void myfunc()
{
  char b[100];
  char *buffer = &b[0];
  strcpy(buffer, "World");
}

Is this correct?  What's a simpler expression for &b[0]?
This is correct. A simpler expression for &b[0] could be &b or just b

5) Consider the following C program.
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  printf("%s %s %s\n", *argv, (*(argv+1)) + 2, *(argv+2));
  return 0;
}

If this code is executed using the following line, what will be the output?
> program1 -n5 abc
Output will be: program1 5 abc

6) Consider the following C program.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
char *myfunc(char **argv)
{
  char buffer[100];
  strcpy(buffer, "hello");
  return buffer;
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char *s = myfunc(argv);
  printf("%s\n", s);
}

What's wrong with this?
The function myFunc, which is called in main function, is trying to return a static array which will automatically become invalid as soon as it comes out of myFunc. Therefore, the program will have runtime error.
