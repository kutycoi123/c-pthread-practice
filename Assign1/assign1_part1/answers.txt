Part 1: Pointers in C
-------------

1) Consider the following C program.
#include <string.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char *temp;
  strcpy(temp, argv[0]);
  return 0;
}

Why is the above code incorrect (i.e., likely to crash)?
The pointer temp is not allocated with any memory space yet. It's just a pointer variable pointing to nowhere. 

2) Consider the following C program.
#include <string.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char temp[9];
  strcpy(temp, argv[0]);
  return 0;
}

A buffer overflow occurs when the program name is 9 characters long
(e.g., "12345.exe"). Why?
Since c string always contain terminating null character '\0' so the name turns out to have 10 characters long
However, temp can only have 9 characters (including null character) so it causes overflow.

3) Consider the following C program.
#include <string.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char *buffer = "Hello";
  strcpy(buffer, "World");
  return 0;
}

Why does this program crash?
Because buffer pointer is poiting to a string literal which behaves like a static memory space so 
any attempt to change values in these static memory space will cause program crash

4) Consider the following C snippet.
void myfunc()
{
  char b[100];
  char *buffer = &b[0];
  strcpy(buffer, "World");
}

Is this correct?  What's a simpler expression for &b[0]?
This is correct. A simpler expression for &b[0] could be &b or just b

5) Consider the following C program.
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  printf("%s %s %s\n", *argv, (*(argv+1)) + 2, *(argv+2));
  return 0;
}

If this code is executed using the following line, what will be the output?
> program1 -n5 abc
Output will be: program1 5 abc

6) Consider the following C program.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
char *myfunc(char **argv)
{
  char buffer[100];
  strcpy(buffer, "hello");
  return buffer;
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char *s = myfunc(argv);
  printf("%s\n", s);
}

What's wrong with this?
The function myFunc, which is called in main function, is trying to return a static array which will automatically become invalid as soon as it comes out of myFunc. Therefore, the program will have runtime error.




Part Two: Fixing the Bugs
-------------------------

Understanding the code

  1) Explain why this program uses the exclamation operator with the
     strcmp() function.

     Here what we want the code to do this logic: 
        - IF the number of arguments is greater than 1 and the second argument is equal to "-test",
          then we run the test and terminate program.
     Hence we want to compare the strings in argv[1] and "-test" using strcmp().
     if both strings are identical(argv[1] equals "-test"), 
     strcmp() returns 0, which means !strcmp() returns 1, which is equivalent to be True value 
     ,therefore, it satisfies the right hand side of if condition.


  2) Explain why the 'LENGTH' macro returns the length of an array.
     Would it work with a pointer to a dynamically allocated array? (Hint:
     understand sizeof).

     In LENGTH macro:
        - sizeof(s) returns the memory allocated(bytes) to s. 
          If s is an array, the returned value is the total size of array.
        - sizeof(*s) returns the amount of memory allocated to the actual value that s is pointing to.
          If s is an array, the returned value is the size of the first element (s[0]).
          It also means the memory size of each value in this array. 
        Therefore, 
          sizeof(s)/sizeof(*s) = (size of all elements) / (size of one element) = number of elements 
     It would not work with a pointer to dynamically allocated array 
     since in such case sizeof(s) will return the size of pointer s (not the size of array). Size of a pointer
     is always 8 bytes in 64-bit operating systems or 4 bytes in 34-bit system.

Bug hunting

  3) Explain and fix the logical flow bug within the switch statement.
     (What happens when the -h option is used?)
     The switch statement is looking at the second character (after character '-') of user option:  
          - If the character is 'h: call function printHelp to print out helping statement.
            There is no break statement inside this case so it will continue to execute codes inside default block 
          - Default block: print out sentence to indicate invalid option
     The original code contains a bug inside switch statement since it doesn't break when user enters "-h" and instead the program continues to run the default block and other codes below.
     The solution is to add break statement right after calling printHelp() inside the first case block.

  4) Explain and fix the argument parsing error. (Why is entrycount never
     zero?)
     Entrycount is never zero because:
        - When entering the first loop, the argv pointer is still pointing to the first argument string which turns out
        to be "./main". Therefore the code will always execute this block for the first loop:
          if (entryCount < LENGTH(entries)) {
            entries[entryCount].word = *argv;
            entries[entryCount++].counter = 0;
          }
        since the entryCount is initialized as 0 so it satisfies the if condition,
        therefore, it increases the entryPoint by one after running this line "entries[entryCount++].counter = 0;"
        As a result, the entryPoint is alwaysed increased to 1 after the first loop no matter how many words a user enters
     Solution:
        - Increase argv pointer by one so that it points to the actual entered word before going into the while loop (above the while statment)
  5) Fix print_result() to print results correctly and in the same order
     as the words were specified on the command line.  Explain your solution.
     - The current print_result() is now only printing out in the reverse order. 
     - Fixed print_result() looks like: 
        void print_result(WordCountEntry entries[], int entry_count)
        {
          printf("Result:\n");
          int i = 0;
          while (i < entry_count) {
            printf("%s:%d\n", entries[i].word, entries[i].counter);
            i++;
          }
        }
        In order to print results in correct order, it iterates through entries array
        from 0 to the entry_count - 1 index and for each element, print out its word and counter.
